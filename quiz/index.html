  <h2> 3 Impactful Things I've Learned </h2>
  <ol type="1">
  <li> How to host a public website </li>
  		<p> Learning how to host a public website was really cool because <br>
  			we've spent a lot of time learning HTML and I've always wanted <br>
  			to know how to make my website accessible to others. It was <br>
  			very exciting visiting my website and obtaining a public url <br>
  			for the first time. </p>
  <li> How to use the command prompt to pull and commit from github </li>
  		<p> I was a little confused at first because I didn't realize that my <br>
  			computer didn't have git installed. But after I got it working, I <br>
  			realized how much easier it is to use the command prompt rather <br>
  			than using github desktop, like we do on robotics. </p>
  <li> The background behind how a website works </li>
  		<p> This was really cool to learn because I've never even heard of <br>
  			backend development before. I really enjoyed learning all then <br>
  		hidden work that goes into running a website. </p>
</ol>
