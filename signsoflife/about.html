  <h3> Why this topic? </h3>
  <p> The search for extraterrestrial life is an interesting topic because it's really a search to answer the question, "are we<br> alone in the universe?" The universe is so incredibly vast and we've explored so much of it, and yet we haven't found any <br>
   other life. How is it that the Earth is so teeming with life, and no other planet we've explored is? </p>
